# Invisible-Cloak
 Being a harry potter fan I always had a childhood fantasy of using an invisibility cloak. Well it turns out that using simple image processing tricks I can now actually fulfil my childhood fantasy. This code turns a red colour cloth into an invisibility cloak.  It's a fun application which you will enjoy using. You can learn some key functions of opencv from this project. 
 
 
 # How it Works? 
 
 Capture and store the background frame.  
 Detect the red colored cloth using color detection algorithm. 
 Segment out the red colored cloth by generating a mask.
 Generate the final augmented output to create the magical effect.
